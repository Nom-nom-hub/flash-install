# Flash Install Vercel Integration

This document provides detailed information about integrating Flash Install with Vercel deployments.

## Overview

Flash Install is a drop-in replacement for npm, yarn, and pnpm that dramatically speeds up dependency installation through deterministic caching and parallel operations. When integrated with Vercel, it can reduce build times by 30-50%.

## Installation

### Option 1: Vercel Marketplace (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations)
2. Search for "Flash Install"
3. Click "Add Integration"
4. Follow the prompts to configure the integration

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up the integration manually:

1. Add the Flash Install Vercel plugin to your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @flash-install/vercel-plugin
```

2. Create a `vercel.json` file in your project root (or update your existing one):

```json
{
  "buildPlugins": [
    {
      "name": "@flash-install/vercel-plugin",
      "config": {
        "enableCache": true,
        "cacheCompression": true,
        "concurrency": 4,
        "fallbackToNpm": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enableCache` | boolean | `true` | Enable flash-install's deterministic caching |
| `cacheCompression` | boolean | `true` | Enable compression for cached packages |
| `concurrency` | number | `4` | Number of concurrent package installations |
| `fallbackToNpm` | boolean | `true` | Fall back to npm if flash-install encounters an error |
| `cloudCache` | boolean | `false` | Enable cloud caching (Enterprise feature) |
| `cloudProvider` | string | `"vercel"` | Cloud provider for caching |
| `syncPolicy` | string | `"upload-if-missing"` | Cache synchronization policy |
| `teamSharing` | boolean | `false` | Share cache across team (Enterprise feature) |
| `metrics` | boolean | `true` | Collect performance metrics |

## Advanced Configuration

For more advanced configuration, you can create a `.flash-install.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "cloudCache": true,
  "cloudProvider": "vercel",
  "syncPolicy": "upload-if-missing",
  "concurrency": 10,
  "vercelIntegration": {
    "enabled": true,
    "teamSharing": true,
    "metrics": true
  }
}
```

## Monorepo Support

Flash Install has built-in support for monorepos. For Vercel deployments with monorepos:

1. Make sure your `vercel.json` is in the root of your monorepo
2. Flash Install will automatically detect workspace packages
3. Dependencies will be installed in the correct order

For Turborepo users, Flash Install integrates seamlessly with Turborepo's caching mechanism.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Installation Fails

If the installation fails, check the following:

1. Make sure your project is compatible with the latest version of Node.js
2. Check if your package.json has any unusual dependencies
3. Verify that your lockfile is valid and up-to-date

#### Cache Not Working

If caching doesn't seem to be working:

1. Make sure `enableCache` is set to `true`
2. Check if your project has a `.npmrc` file that might be affecting caching
3. Verify that you have sufficient disk space

#### Slow Builds

If builds are still slow:

1. Increase the `concurrency` setting
2. Enable `cacheCompression` to reduce network transfer times
3. Consider using the Enterprise cloud caching feature

## Enterprise Features

Flash Install offers additional features for enterprise users:

### Team Cache Sharing

Share dependency caches across your entire team to eliminate redundant downloads and installations.

### Cloud Cache

Store your dependency cache in the cloud (S3, Azure, GCP) for persistent caching across CI/CD environments.

### Advanced Analytics

Get detailed insights into your dependency installation performance and optimization opportunities.

### Priority Support

Enterprise users receive priority support and assistance with integration.

## Performance Optimization Tips

To get the most out of Flash Install with Vercel:

1. **Use lockfiles**: Always commit your lockfile (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, or pnpm-lock.yaml)
2. **Optimize dependencies**: Regularly audit and clean up unused dependencies
3. **Increase concurrency**: On high-performance build machines, increase the concurrency setting
4. **Enable compression**: Keep cacheCompression enabled to reduce network transfer times
5. **Consider monorepo structure**: Organize your monorepo to minimize cross-dependencies
