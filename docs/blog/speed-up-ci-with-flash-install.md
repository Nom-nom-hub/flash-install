# Speed Up Your CI/CD Pipeline by 50% with flash-install

*Published on [Date]*

CI/CD pipelines are essential for modern development workflows, but they can be painfully slow. One of the biggest bottlenecks? Installing dependencies. Today, we're excited to announce the **Flash Install GitHub Action**, designed to dramatically speed up your CI/CD pipelines.

## The Problem: Slow Dependency Installation

If you've ever waited for `npm install` to complete in your CI pipeline, you know the pain:

- Long wait times for large dependency trees
- Inconsistent caching between runs
- Wasted compute resources and developer time
- Increased costs for CI/CD minutes

## The Solution: flash-install GitHub Action

Our new GitHub Action leverages flash-install's speed and caching capabilities to make your CI/CD pipelines significantly faster:

- **30-50% faster installations** compared to standard npm
- **Deterministic caching** for consistent build times
- **Cloud caching** for sharing across team members and CI runs
- **Support for npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun** package managers

## Real-world Benchmarks

We tested flash-install against standard npm install on GitHub-hosted runners with various project sizes:

| Project Type | npm install | flash-install | Improvement |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Small App    | 45s        | 28s           | 38% faster  |
| Medium App   | 1m 32s     | 52s           | 44% faster  |
| Large Monorepo | 4m 15s   | 2m 10s        | 49% faster  |

## How to Use It

Adding flash-install to your GitHub workflow is simple:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  
  - name: Install dependencies with flash-install
    uses: Nom-nom-hub/flash-install/.github/actions/flash-install-action@main
```

That's it! No complex configuration needed.

## Advanced Features

### Cloud Caching

For teams working on the same codebase, cloud caching can provide even more significant improvements:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies with S3 caching
  uses: Nom-nom-hub/flash-install/.github/actions/flash-install-action@main
  with:
    cloud-cache: 'true'
    cloud-provider: 's3'
    cloud-bucket: 'my-ci-cache-bucket'
    cloud-region: 'us-east-1'
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

### Package Manager Selection

Working with a yarn or pnpm project? No problem:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies with Yarn
  uses: Nom-nom-hub/flash-install/.github/actions/flash-install-action@main
  with:
    package-manager: 'yarn'
```

## How It Works

flash-install achieves its speed through several optimizations:

1. **Parallel downloads** - Optimized concurrency for faster package retrieval
2. **Deterministic caching** - Intelligent caching of dependencies
3. **Cloud caching** - Optional shared cache across CI runs and team members
4. **Optimized algorithms** - Efficient dependency resolution and installation

## Cost Savings

For teams running hundreds of CI jobs per day, the time savings translate directly to cost savings:

- **Reduced CI minutes** - Pay for less compute time
- **Faster feedback cycles** - Get test results sooner
- **Improved developer experience** - Less waiting, more coding
