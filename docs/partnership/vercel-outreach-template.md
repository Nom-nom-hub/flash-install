Speeding up Next.js builds by 45% with flash-install

## Email Body:

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I've developed flash-install, a high-performance npm replacement that's showing impressive results with Next.js projects.

In our benchmarks with Next.js applications, we're seeing 40-45% faster dependency installation times compared to standard npm install. This translates to significantly faster Vercel deployments, especially for larger projects and monorepos.

### Key highlights for Next.js developers:

- **40-45% faster** dependency installation for Next.js projects
- **Cloud caching** that persists across deployments
- **Deterministic caching** for consistent build times
- **VS Code extension** for improved developer experience
- **Support for all package managers** including npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun

I believe flash-install could be valuable for Vercel users looking to optimize their deployment times, and I'd love to explore a potential integration or partnership.

Specifically, I'd like to discuss:
1. Creating a Vercel integration for flash-install
2. Developing optimized caching strategies for Next.js projects
3. Exploring how we might collaborate on performance improvements for Vercel deployments

Here's our GitHub repo: https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/flash-install

Would you have 15 minutes to chat next week? I'm available [provide 2-3 time slots].

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about flash-install, our npm replacement that's showing significant performance improvements for Next.js projects.

Since I last reached out, we've created a proof-of-concept Vercel deployment plugin that demonstrates how flash-install can reduce dependency installation times by 40-45% for Next.js applications.

I'd love to share this with you and discuss how we might bring these performance improvements to Vercel users.

Would [suggest a specific date/time] work for a quick 15-minute chat?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
