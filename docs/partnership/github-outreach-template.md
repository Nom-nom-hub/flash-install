flash-install GitHub Action reduces CI build times by 40%

## Email Body:

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I've developed flash-install, a drop-in npm replacement that's gaining traction (950+ weekly downloads) for its speed and cloud caching capabilities.

Our new GitHub Action is showing 30-50% faster CI builds in real-world tests, particularly for monorepos and projects with large dependency trees. I believe this could be valuable for GitHub users looking to optimize their Actions workflows.

### Key highlights:

- **30-50% faster** than standard npm install
- **Cloud caching** with S3, Azure, and GCP support
- **Support for npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun**
- **Deterministic caching** for consistent builds
- **VS Code extension** for improved developer experience

I'd love to:
1. Get your feedback on our GitHub Action
2. Discuss how we might collaborate to improve npm workflows for GitHub users
3. Explore if this would be valuable for a GitHub blog post or case study

Here's a quick demo: [link to demo or screenshot]

Would you have 15 minutes to chat next week? I'm available [provide 2-3 time slots].

Best regards,
Andrew Edouard

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about flash-install, our npm replacement that's showing significant performance improvements in GitHub Actions workflows.

Since I last reached out, we've added [mention any new feature or improvement], and our weekly downloads have increased to [updated number].

I'd still love to get your thoughts on how we might collaborate to bring these performance improvements to more GitHub users.

Would [suggest a specific date/time] work for a quick 15-minute chat?

Best regards,
Andrew Edouard
