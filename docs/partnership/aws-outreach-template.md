Optimizing S3 for JavaScript dependency caching with flash-install

## Email Body:

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I've developed flash-install, a high-performance npm replacement with advanced S3 caching capabilities that's gaining traction among JavaScript developers.

Our solution leverages AWS S3 for cloud caching of JavaScript dependencies, providing significant performance improvements for both development and CI/CD workflows. We're seeing 30-50% faster dependency installation times compared to standard npm install.

### Key AWS integrations:

- **S3 caching** with optimized storage patterns
- **Team permissions** aligned with AWS IAM
- **CloudFormation templates** for easy setup
- **Multi-region support** for global teams
- **Compliance features** for enterprise customers

I believe there's potential for a deeper integration with AWS services, particularly for customers using CodeBuild, Amplify, and other JavaScript-heavy AWS services.

Specifically, I'd like to discuss:
1. Optimizing our S3 integration for AWS customers
2. Exploring AWS Marketplace opportunities
3. Potential integration with AWS developer tools

Here's our GitHub repo: https://github.com/Nom-nom-hub/flash-install

Would you have 15 minutes to chat next week about how we might collaborate? I'm available [provide 2-3 time slots].

Best regards,
Andrew Edouard

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about flash-install, our npm replacement with advanced S3 caching capabilities.

Since I last reached out, we've enhanced our AWS integration with [mention any new feature or improvement], and we're seeing even more impressive performance metrics with AWS CodeBuild.

I'd love to share these results with you and discuss how we might collaborate to bring these performance improvements to more AWS customers.

Would [suggest a specific date/time] work for a quick 15-minute chat?

Best regards,
Andrew Edouard
