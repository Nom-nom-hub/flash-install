# Introducing Flash Install for Vercel: Up to 50% Faster Builds

We're excited to announce that Flash Install is now available as an official Vercel integration! This integration brings Flash Install's blazingly fast dependency installation to your Vercel deployments, reducing build times by up to 50%.

## The Problem: Slow Dependency Installation

JavaScript dependency installation is often the slowest part of the build process. For large projects or monorepos, it can take minutes to install all dependencies, leading to:

- Slow feedback cycles during development
- Increased compute costs in CI/CD environments
- Frustrated developers waiting for deployments

## The Solution: Flash Install for Vercel

Flash Install dramatically speeds up dependency installation through deterministic caching and parallel operations. When integrated with Vercel, it can reduce build times by 30-50%, with even greater improvements for large projects and monorepos.

### Key Features

- **Faster Builds**: Reduce dependency installation time by up to 50%
- **Smart Caching**: Deterministic caching ensures consistent, reliable builds
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with all JavaScript frameworks (Next.js, Remix, Astro, SvelteKit)
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Fallback Safety**: Automatically falls back to npm if any issues occur

## Performance Benchmarks

We've tested Flash Install with various project types and consistently seen significant performance improvements:

| Project Type | npm install | flash-install | Improvement |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Next.js App | 45.2s | 22.8s | 49.6% |
| E-commerce (Next.js Commerce) | 120.5s | 58.7s | 51.3% |
| Dashboard (Next.js) | 65.8s | 35.2s | 46.5% |
| Astro Blog | 38.2s | 20.1s | 47.4% |
| SvelteKit App | 42.1s | 23.2s | 44.9% |

## How It Works

The Flash Install Vercel integration works by:

1. **Installation**: The plugin installs Flash Install during the Vercel build process
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Flash Install analyzes your package.json and lockfile
3. **Smart Caching**: Packages are cached based on content hashes for deterministic builds
4. **Parallel Installation**: Dependencies are installed in parallel for maximum speed
5. **Snapshot Creation**: A snapshot is created for even faster future builds

## Getting Started

Adding Flash Install to your Vercel projects is simple:

1. Go to the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations/flash-install)
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Select the projects you want to enable Flash Install for
4. Configure the integration settings (or use the defaults)
5. Deploy your projects to see the performance improvements
