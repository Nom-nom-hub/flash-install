- Intelligent dependency hoisting to minimize duplication
- Workspace filtering for selective installation

#### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- Reduced memory usage during large installations
- Optimized cache storage format for faster retrieval
- Implemented streaming extraction for faster snapshot restoration
- Batch processing for improved efficiency

#### ✅ Enhanced Offline Mode
- Better detection of network availability
- Fallback strategies for partial offline scenarios
- Warning system for outdated dependencies when working offline
- Automatic mode switching based on connectivity

### Medium Priority Features

#### ✅ Dependency Analysis Tools
- Visualization of dependency graph
- Detection of duplicate dependencies
- Size analysis and reporting
- Multiple output formats (tree, DOT, Markdown, JSON)
- Customizable visualization options

#### ✅ Cloud Cache Integration
- Support for storing/retrieving cache from S3-compatible storage
- Team-shared caching for improved CI/CD performance
- Configurable cache synchronization policies
- Enhanced Cloud Cache Features:
  - NEWEST sync policy for timestamp-based synchronization
  - Support for additional cloud providers (Azure, GCP)
  - Cache invalidation based on lockfile changes
  - Manual sync command for cache synchronization
  - Team permissions and access controls with role-based access
