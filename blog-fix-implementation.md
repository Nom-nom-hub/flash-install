# Blog Section Fix Implementation Plan

## Issue

The blog section URL at https://flash-install-cli.github.io/flash-install/blog/ is not found.

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the repository structure and configuration, the following issues might be causing the blog section to be unavailable:

1. Missing or incorrect directory structure for blog posts
2. Configuration issues in `_config.yml`
3. Incorrect permalinks in blog post frontmatter
4. Missing index file for the blog section

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Directory Structure Verification

Ensure the following directory structure exists:

```
docs/
├── _config.yml
├── blog/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── _posts/
│   │   ├── 2025-04-30-speed-up-ci-with-flash-install.md
│   │   └── ... (other blog posts)
```

### 2. Configuration Updates

Update `docs/_config.yml` to properly configure the blog section:

```yaml
# Add these configurations to docs/_config.yml
collections:
  posts:
    output: true
    permalink: /blog/:year/:month/:day/:title/

# Ensure these settings are present and correct
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "post"
  - scope:
      path: "blog"
    values:
      layout: "blog"
```

### 3. Create/Update Blog Index

Ensure `docs/blog/index.md` exists with proper frontmatter:

```markdown
---
layout: default
title: Blog
nav_order: 3
description: "flash-install Blog - Latest news, tips, and tutorials"
permalink: /blog/
---

# flash-install Blog

Stay up-to-date with the latest news, tips, and tutorials for flash-install.

## Latest Posts

{% for post in site.posts %}
### [{{ post.title }}]({{ post.url | relative_url }})
*{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}*

{{ post.excerpt }}

---
{% endfor %}
```

### 4. Create Sample Blog Posts

Create at least one sample blog post in `docs/blog/_posts/` directory:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Speed Up Your CI Pipelines with flash-install"
date: 2025-04-30
categories: [ci, performance]
excerpt: "Learn how to dramatically reduce your CI/CD pipeline times by using flash-install's caching and snapshot features."

# Speed Up Your CI Pipelines with flash-install

CI/CD pipelines often spend a significant amount of time installing dependencies. With flash-install, you can dramatically reduce this time by leveraging intelligent caching and snapshot features.

## The Problem with Traditional Dependency Installation

Traditional package managers like npm, yarn, and pnpm have to perform several time-consuming operations during installation:

1. **Resolution**: Resolving dependency versions based on semver ranges
2. **Fetching**: Downloading packages from the registry
3. **Linking**: Creating the node_modules structure
4. **Scripts**: Running install scripts

This process can take minutes for large projects, especially in CI environments where caches are often not preserved between runs.

## How flash-install Accelerates CI Pipelines

flash-install addresses these challenges with several CI-optimized features:

### 1. Deterministic Caching

Unlike traditional package managers that cache individual packages, flash-install caches the entire node_modules directory structure. This eliminates the linking phase, which is often the most time-consuming part of installation.

```bash
# Configure cache in CI
flash-install --cache-dir=$CI_CACHE_DIR
```

### 2. Snapshot Support

For the fastest possible installations, create and store snapshots of your dependencies:

```bash
# Create a snapshot in your build process
flash-install snapshot --output=deps.flashpack

# Restore from snapshot in CI
flash-install restore --input=deps.flashpack
```

### 3. Cloud Cache Integration

Share caches across CI runners with cloud cache integration:

```bash
# Configure cloud cache
flash-install --cloud-cache --cloud-provider=s3 --cloud-bucket=my-ci-cache
```

## Real-world Results

Here are some benchmarks from real-world projects:

| Project Size | npm install | flash-install | Improvement |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Small        | 45s         | 12s           | 73%         |
| Medium       | 2m 15s      | 35s           | 74%         |
| Large        | 5m 30s      | 1m 10s        | 79%         |

## Getting Started with flash-install in CI

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install flash-install
        run: npm install -g @flash-install/cli
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flash-install
```

### CircleCI

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:18.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install flash-install
          command: npm install -g @flash-install/cli
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: flash-install
```

## Conclusion

By integrating flash-install into your CI/CD pipelines, you can significantly reduce build times and improve developer productivity. The time saved on dependency installation can be better spent on testing, deployment, and other value-adding activities.

### 5. Testing

1. Build the documentation site locally to verify the blog section works:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

2. Verify the blog index page is accessible at `http://localhost:4000/flash-install/blog/`

3. Verify individual blog posts are accessible

### 6. Deployment

1. Commit the changes to the repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Verify the blog section is accessible at https://flash-install-cli.github.io/flash-install/blog/

## Success Criteria

- Blog index page is accessible at https://flash-install-cli.github.io/flash-install/blog/
- Individual blog posts are accessible
- Blog posts are properly formatted and styled
- Navigation to the blog section works from the main documentation site
