## Bug Triage Process

1. **Severity Classification**:
   - **Critical**: Prevents core functionality from working
   - **High**: Significantly impacts user experience
   - **Medium**: Affects functionality but has workarounds
   - **Low**: Minor issues with minimal impact

2. **Fix Priority**:
   - Critical and High severity bugs must be fixed before release
   - Medium severity bugs should be fixed if time permits
   - Low severity bugs can be deferred to future releases

3. **Regression Testing**:
   - All bug fixes must include regression tests
   - Full test suite must pass after fixes are applied

## Release Criteria

The v1.9 release will be considered ready when:

1. All planned features are implemented and tested
2. No critical or high severity bugs remain
3. Test coverage meets or exceeds targets
4. Performance benchmarks show improvement over v1.8
5. Documentation is complete and accurate
6. Release candidate has been tested in production-like environments

## Post-Release Monitoring

After release, monitor:

1. Download statistics
2. GitHub issues for bug reports
3. Performance metrics from telemetry (if enabled)
4. Community feedback on forums and social media
